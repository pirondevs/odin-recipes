<h2>Description</h2>
<p> Mangú is traditionally made by mashing boiled green plantains with a mix of its water, oil, and/or butter.
 It is heavily influenced by African cuisine as it comes from Africa’s Congo Region which was brought to the 
 island during the slavery trade. While plantains had first arrived in Santo Domingo from the Canary Islands 
 in the early 1500s, it was already an established crop in West Africa.

 Creamy, rich and delicious, mangu is one of my favorite plantain recipes. Dominica mashed plantain is super
 simple to make, but is full of flavor. Serve as part of a breakfast, or as a side dish.
