<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
 My family loves seasoned fries and with 4 children the bag of fries from the store became too expensive. So I tried
  batter — after all, it makes chicken, shrimp, and onion rings crispy so why not potatoes! Now even my husband can't 
  get enough of these French fries. They even stay crispy when you reheat them in the microwave.
</p>

<p>Skip the drive-thru and make irresistible seasoned fries at home. This seasoned French fry recipe creates fries that
  are crispy on the outside, but fluffy and tender on the inside. </p>

 <li>1 teaspoon onion salt</li>
 <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
