 <h2 class="title">How to prepare a Smash Burger</h2>
 <div class="para">
  <p>Smash burgers are formed into balls of ground beef then pressed or smashed with a <b><u>burger press</u></b> into a thin patty 
   as soon as they hit the grill. This creates extra browning and flavor on the outside while maintaining the patty’s juiciness.
  </p>
 
  <p>We love burgers, from classic <b><u>Juicy Burgers</u></b> to <b><u>Cheeseburger Sliders</u></b>. Making your own patty from ground beef tastes so much
   better than flash-frozen or fast-food patties. These go down easier and you feel better after eating a fresh homemade burger because
   you control the quality of ingredients

<h2 class="subtitles steps">Steps by Steps</h2>
<ol>
 <li><b>Prepare Patties</b> – Divide 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef into 8 equal portions (3 oz each), cover, and refrigerate until ready to cook.</li>
 <li><b>Make Sauce</b> – Stir together 1/3 cup mayo and 1 tsp mustard and set aside.</li>
 <li><b>Prep Toppings</b> – fully prep your toppings ahead to assemble the burgers right away while the patties are hot and juicy off the grill.</li>
 <li><b>Toast buns</b> – lightly butter the cut side of your buns and toast on a griddle or skillet over medium heat until golden brown. Transfer to a rack.</li>
 <li><b>Cook patties</b> – increase to medium-high heat. Depending on your surface area, place 2 to 4 cold pieces of meat onto the hot surface. Working quickly, cover each 
  piece with a sheet of parchment paper and smash each into a thin patty. Remove parchment paper, season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder, add a dab of sauce, and 
  flip. Sear for 2 minutes on the first side and about a minute on the second side.</li>
 <li><b>Add cheese</b> – place a slice of cheese onto half of the patties and top with a second patty and remove from heat. Serve warm over toasted buns with toppings.</li>
